### Decryptix Game 


There are two ways to play Decryptix:
Try to guess a pattern created by this program or the program can try it with a pattern
created by you.

If you are the one who will guess, the program will generate a code (eg abcde). In each
turn you will try to guess the code, the program will tell you in each turn how many 
letters are correct and how many are in the right position.

The goal is to discover the code so fast as possible. You determine how many letters and 
how many positions you can use.

If the program have to guess, you have that create a code and rate each one of its attempts.
